# imdb_webscraping
In this project, I developed a web scraper using Python and the BeautifulSoup library to extract data from IMDb. The goal was to collect the titles of the top 25 movies as ranked by user ratings. By accessing the IMDb search page for the top 25 movies and parsing the HTML content, the script successfully navigates through the page structure to retrieve and display the movie titles. This project demonstrates the practical application of web scraping techniques to automate data collection from a dynamic website, which can be useful for various data analysis and research purposes.
